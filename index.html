    <h1>Santa Claus</h1>
    <h2>Who really is Santa Claus</h2>
    <p><strong>Nicholas</strong>. The legend of Santa Claus can be traced back hundreds of years to a monk named St. Nicholas. Nicholas was born at 280 a.d, A.D stands for Anno Domini which is Latin for <q>Year of our lord</q>and it means the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ. As you can see on our BC AD timeline, the years before Jesus was born are BC – Before Christ.</p>

    <h2>Is Santa Claus Real?</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, Santa Claus is real. The real name of Santa Claus was Saint Nicholas, also known as Kris Kringle. The story dates back to the 3rd century. Saint Nicholas was born in 280 A.D. in Patara, near Myra in modern-day Turkey. but on a second thought Santa or Nicholas will not give gifts but he can give some.</p>

    <h1>Carolings</h1>
    <h2>Who invented Carolings?</h2>
    <p>Carols were being collected and printed widely by the 19th century. And in 1880, it's believed the Christmas carol service was invented in Truro by an Edward White Benson, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
    
    <h2>What is special of Carolings</h2>
    <p>It's about nothing else but merrily singing songs from door to door in the spirit of the holiday season. Christmas carols were very popular decades ago, before there was digital entertainment to distract us.</p>

<div id="History" class="Category">
    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>Why do we had to celebrate christmas?</h2>
    <p>Christmas is celebrated to remember the birth of Jesus Christ, who Christians believe is the Son of God. The name 'Christmas' comes from the Mass of Christ (or Jesus). A Mass service (which is sometimes called Communion or Eucharist) is where Christians remember that Jesus died for us and then came back to life.</p>

    <h2>Who Invented Christmas?</h2>
    <p>The first recorded incidence of Christmas being celebrated actually dates all the way back to the Roman Empire in 336, during the time of the Roman Emperor Constantine – so technically the Romans invented it, although there's no specific person who is credited with having done so.</p>


    <h2>what was christmas first called</h2>

    <p>The pre-Christian Germanic peoples—including the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse—celebrated a winter festival called Yule, held in the late December to early January period, yielding modern English yule, today used as a synonym for Christmas.</p>
